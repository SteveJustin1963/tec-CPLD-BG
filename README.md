1Scteptfem1bper f25m9 0soat9 e6:4mc6 Pd1M  Â· 
Altera (Intel) epm3064 CPLD, 3.3v regulator, decoupling caps, DIP 28 footprint. 6 pin jtag header. 
All 5v tolerant IO. 3.3v logic is compatible with 5v logic. 
64 logic elements in this little thing. Consider a LE a latch or a register or a gate.  64 LEs can make 64bits of ram, or a 64bit counter, or 64 bit adder/subtractor/ spi port, DAC, PWM, just about anything you could do with a handfull of 74 series chips all in one DIP. 
You could build a video card with a couple of these, some ram and an EPROM. Or a serial port, keyboard controller, configurable address decoder / mapper etc. 
Erase and rewrite code to these at least 1000 times.
Smd fully assembled. 28 and 6 pin header included but not soldered. 
$13.50ea. Or $8ea unassembled kit.

Iâ€™ll grab a couple of unassembled ones please.ðŸ˜Š
These have an oscillator too?â€¦ See More

Scott Gregory That sounds awesome! probably stick with the drag n drop schematic editor though as HDL could be a bit of a distraction

Yep. That works. You have the pinout/schematic available of these boards?

I do but it looks very confusing! I'll draw something simple up now

Esentially a 27Cxx pinout. 14 and 28 as Vss and Vcc and a JTAG header.

thats a bit better.
May be an image of text that says '42 43 44 2 3 5 6 8 10 12 13 14 15 GND VCC 35 34 33 31 28 27 25 23 22 21 20 19 18 TDI TCK TMS GND 3.3 TDO'

Step2. Right click, insert symbol, find what you want to insert. Can be simple gates, or you can look in megafunnctions for the 74 series chips. Just click and place where you want

Save, and click the Play button. It'll compile your design into code, show you how many IO pins you've used, and how many logic elements you've used

Step5. Click on Pin planner, then drag and drop the pin names to the physical pins on the chip. If you named your signals in the schematic, it makes it much easier. You can place them where ever you like. I've only used IO pins in the CPLDip

Hit compile again, and now you're ready to put your code onto the CPLD. Use the programmer icon, connect your usb blaster, click program. It'll be finished in 2 seconds and you're ready to use your custom IC

When you put it like that it almost sounds easy... ðŸ™‚

Reinoud de Lange Once you get your head around it, it isn't hard at all. I learned VHDL (the hardware description language) first as I was doing a complex device first up. Ben was a huge help with that.
